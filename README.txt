READMEProject/App Name: Pho Shizzle Author and Programmer: Ben WongI really don’t like how Yelp, and Zomato dumps a plethora of restaurants to you and let you parse and filter it. I also don’t like how many navigations it takes to see my favourite cuisine – Pho (Vietnamese noodle). When I am out, I only care about Pho Restaurants near me, something that takes me 5 – 10 minutes to get to. A highly rated restaurant is irrelevant to me if it is very far and takes me more than 15 minutes to get there when I am starving. I am don’t like going to multiple sources separately to look for reviews – Yelp, Zomato, and Google Place (FourSquare and TripAdvisor have some restaurant reviews but there are not a lot). I built Pho Shizzle to solve the convoluted navigation of Zomato and Yelp. It pulls in only restaurants near you sorted by km, and it solves the problem of having to go to multiple sources for restaurant ratings. It pulls in ratings from Yelp, Zomato, and Google Place under one roof. Opening the app shows all Pho restaurants nearby sorted by km. Tapping on the individual restaurant takes you to the detail page that shows the location on a map of where the restaurant is, all the relevant reviews, the address, and phone number of the restaurant. There is also a feature that allows a user to save his or her favourite restaurant using Core Data by pressing the “Save Pho” button. A Favourite Pho tab shows all the restaurants that are saved.  The “Get Pho” button opens up the GPS navigation that takes you to the restaurant.
